# BeyondChats

BeyondChats is a chat platform project designed to go beyond traditional messaging experiences. The repository is organized into a `Server` directory for backend code and a `client` directory for frontend code, primarily using JavaScript. 

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sakshikrai/BeyondChats.git
   cd BeyondChats
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the `Server` and `client` directories separately and run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - This will install all required packages as listed in the `package-lock.json`.

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Check for any `.env.example` files in `Server` or `client` for required environment variables.
   - Copy to `.env` and fill out the necessary fields.

## How to Run

### Server
- Navigate to the `Server` directory and run:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- This starts the backend server.

### Client
- Navigate to the `client` directory and run:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- This starts the frontend development server (typically on `localhost:3000`).

## How Was the Project Built?

- **Languages & Frameworks:** The project uses JavaScript, with Node.js for the backend and likely React or a similar framework for the frontend.
- **Structure:** The codebase is divided into `Server` (backend) and `client` (frontend) directories for modularity.
- **Package Management:** Uses npm for dependency management; see `package-lock.json` for details.

---

## What's Done

- Initial project scaffolding and code for both server and client are created.
- Core dependencies are installed and project structure is set up.
- Basic run scripts for development are in place.

---

## What's Missing

- The README does not yet include specific details on features, endpoints, or UI components.
- Further documentation is needed for API usage and advanced configuration.
- Testing scripts and deployment instructions may not be present.
- Feature descriptions and screenshots are to be added as the project evolves.

---

## Use of LLM Tools

- Large Language Model (LLM) tools (like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT) were used for:
  - Generating code scaffolding and boilerplate.
  - Assisting with documentation and setup instructions.
  - Providing suggestions for project structure and organization.
